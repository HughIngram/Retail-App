# Retail App

## This feature branch
- Get the list from the API, and print it to logcat
    * CLEAN

## Planning Approach
- Translate spec into user stories / tasks
- Arrange tasks by MoSCoW
- Try top-down design (as though this project were much larger)
    * i.e. plan from a high level first
    * build the structure of the app sooner rather than later
- Priorities backlog with Trello card-order

## Coding Approach
- start clean, rather than starting messy then refactoring
"We will evaluate architecture, code quality and consistency over feature completeness."
- "inline documentation" - write comments on public methods
